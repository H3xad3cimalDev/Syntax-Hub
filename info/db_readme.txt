Description:
Hi! I guess you're snooping around in Syntax Hub's JSON Database.
Basically this is where all your personal settings are kept!
I'll explain how it works.

To find the game you want you want to edit your configuration
then find the game's place id and make sure the file extension is ".syntax_h.json"

Notes:
    * Editing a value will need to be in it's type.
        for example if you're editing a string then
        you need to make it a string or else it will
        break something
    * Make sure it's in a JSON format
    * Make sure that a value is in it's limit.
        Like if we have a integer value that it's limit
        is 5 and you make it 6 it will probably break
        something.
    * Also if you're a scripter I recommend you NOT
        to use this folder since I want to keep
        the structure clean as possible
